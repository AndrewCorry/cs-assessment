For the tiny and small arrays, the insert function was actually faster than the append function.
The functions were about the same speed for the medium array.
For large and extra large, the insert function was drastically slower than append.
The append functions scales much better than the insert function the longer the array is, as unshift must go through the entire array each time to add a value.
